# YT Redirect
### STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!!!
## Redirect YouTube videos automatically to alternative frontends.
Have you given up on using adblock on YouTube??? Do you wish to still have your recommendations? Well, this may help!\
This extension redirects you after clicking on a YouTube video to a service of your choice. This lets you keep your YouTube recommendations (and continue being tracked!!!). It will take everything a bit longer to load as it refreshes everything after leaving, but it's still faster than watching an advert (by far)!

## Installation

### Mozilla Add-Ons site
To come!! 

### Manual
1. Download the `.xpi` addon file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/so9010/YT-Redirect/releases/)
2. Go to `about:addons`
3. Click the gear icon and select `Install Add-on From File`

### Cloned repo
1. Clone the repository or download as zip
2. Go to `about:debugging`
3. Click on `This Firefox`
4. Then `Load Temporary Add-on`
5. Select `manifest.json` in the `src/` directory from the cloned repo.

## Want to change the alternative player?
Click on the icon in the toolbar and then change the URL, you should ignore the 'www.' part of it.  

## Want to contribute?
Yes... Yes... YES!!! Please do contribute, this is my first time writing an extension, so any improvements will be welcomed.

## What needs improvement?
There are several things I think it could be better with. For one being speed. Number two I would like it to not register everything to history and only show the one that it gets redirected to.

## Like my work?
