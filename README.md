# YT Redirect

## Redirect YouTube videos automatically to alternative frontends.

This redirects you after clicking on a youtube video to a service of your choice. This lets you keep your youtube recommendations (and continue being tracked!!!).\n
This is the perfect alternative if you have given up with using an adblocker.

## Installation

### Mozilla Add-Ons site
To come!! 

### Manual
Also to come!!

1. Clone the repository or download as zip
2. Go to `about:debugging`
3. Click on `This Firefox`
4. Then `Load Temporary Add-on`
5. Select `manifest.json` in the `src/` directory from the cloned repo.

## Want to change the alternative player?
Click on the icon in the toolbar and then change the URL, you should ignore the 'www.' part of it.
